Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, causing substantial financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions. Machine learning techniques provide a powerful way to identify patterns that indicate potential fraudulent activities.

This project utilizes a dataset containing various features from credit card transactions and applies machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a collection of transactions, including features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical variables derived from the transaction details. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset has been anonymized and preprocessed.

Methods
Several machine learning algorithms are employed to train and evaluate the model for fraud detection, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
naive 
decision tree
Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are utilized to measure the model's performance.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
Install the required dependencies:

Data Preparation:

The dataset needs to be preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
Training the Model:

Run the training script to fit the machine learning models.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
Results
The results of the model evaluation are as follows:


The best performing model is [logestic regression] with an accuracy of[99.4].
